# Face Detection and Recognition System

A real-time **Face Detection and Recognition System** built using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
This project detects human faces from images or live webcam video and recognizes known faces using a trained model.

## 📌 Features

- Face detection using **Haar Cascade Classifier**
- Face recognition using **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)**
- Real-time recognition via **webcam**
- Face dataset creation and training support
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
- GUI support (optional – Tkinter)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Haar Cascade Classifier
